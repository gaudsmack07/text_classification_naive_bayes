# text_classification_naive_bayes
Implementing Naive Bayes based Text Classification with and without using sklearn

In this, we try to accomplish the following tasks:
-Perform Test Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes (using sklearn's inbuilt function).
-Build a text classification system by writing a Naive Bayes function from scratch, ie without using sklearn.
